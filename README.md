# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Purpose

### This repository was created with the intention of processing a fresh Independent Funding dataset containing details on backers who had made commitments to active projects. employing an ETL procedure on this data set and SQL queries for data analysis. The extraction and transformation phases were carried out with the aid of Python, Pandas, and Jupyter. creating a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file by extracting and manipulating sponsors' contact information from a CSV file. An ERD was made using the dataset, and a new table was added to the crowdfunding db database using a table schema. Add the CSV file containing the sponsors' information to this table. Finally, you will use SQL queries to conduct data analysis on the crowdfunding db database.
